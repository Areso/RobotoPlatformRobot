# Robotoplatform

This project is dedicated to create a robotoplatform for telepresence and guarding/patroling tasks, to use in private houses instead of watchdogs. The robot will complement security alarm sensors, such as movements sensors, volume sensors, heat sensors and so on.</br>

Of course, there are a lot of complete solutions, which could be bought, but my goal was to create low-cost system at least for teleprensence task.
